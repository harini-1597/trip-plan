<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üìå About The Project
- An all in one place travel companion app where-in users can view details about their city of choice like:
  - Local News
  - Directions / Map
  - Weather
  - Landmarks _(under development)_
  - Restaurants _(under development)_
- The components are different websites on their own, all built by me.
- While the components use pure HTML CSS JS, the main SaaS platform utilizes NextJS
  - This was done as the components in themselves are simple to render but NextJS was best for making a dynamic platform with routing, etc
  - Also the UI components from ShadCN makes the main website look much more professional
